					<h2>Cities have became <b>crowded physical spaces</b>, but
					<br />
					did the city environment contributed to our isolation?</h2>

					<p>Neighbourhoods provide important support, either if you're locked outside in the rain, or if you need them not to call the police
					<br />when you throw a birthday party. We don't keep as much contact with our upstairs neighbours as we should.

					<br />
					We are aiming to solve that with a solution to bring local communities together.</p>
